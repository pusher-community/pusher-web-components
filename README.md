# Pusher Chat Web Components

Written to accompany [this blog post on web components][blogPost].

## Running locally

- `git clone` this repository
- `cd pusher-web-components`
- open `index.html` in your browser

You will also need a small server for the realtime chat component to talk to. You can use our [Sinatra Server][sinatraServer] or create your own.
